10/5/16
This site is being created for practice and for a multi-phase assignment for a web development class focusing in PHP.
Most of the pages are saved as php files but contains much HMTL. 
The PHP is being used as of now to save cookies and check for their existance. 
It is also being used to do contact emails and form validation for a user new user signup.
